'''
Write a program that asks the user to enter numbers until
they input an empty string to quit. At the end, the program
prints out the five greatest numbers sorted in descending order.
Hint: You can reverse the order of sorted list items by using the
sort method with the reverse=True argument.

number = []



for i in range(100):
    user = input("Enter the number: ")
    if user == "":
        break

    user = int(user)
    
    number.append(int(user))
    
number.sort(reverse=True)
print(number[:5])
